    <h1>Hello! Welcome to Katie's Data Visualization Assignment #3!</h1>

    <h2>
      Below is a choropleth map that I created in Datawrapper. Enjoy!

    <p>
      <iframe title="Total Floods in the U.S. by State from 1985 to 2018" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Sh5MW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Sh5MW/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="481"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

  <p>
    Several types of natural disasters occur throughout the United States every year, one type being floods. As illustrated in the map above, it is clear that the states of California and Texas are unproportionally affected compared to the rest of the country. The reason behind Texas' extremely high number of floods has to do with its terrain. Most of the ground in Texas is covered by rocky, clay-rich soil with steep inclines, making it extremely susceptible to major flooding.
